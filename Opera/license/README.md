# Licensing information for Opera component

Opera component as delivered in the packaged tgz uses programs from Ubuntu and HDInsight and there is no linking, modification or other similar potentially problematic ways forms of use.

However, to be able to actually use the Opera component, MS SQL-server JDBC driver must be separately installed as we interpreted Microsoft's license as disallowing us to package it in our delivery package. The practical procedure for this is documented in KäyttöönOtto.md.
