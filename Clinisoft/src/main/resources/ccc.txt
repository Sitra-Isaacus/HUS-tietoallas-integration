           PV_PatientInfo
                             The database view "PV_PatientInfo" contains detailed data on a patient. Please be careful 
                             using this database view in combination with others because the maximum table limit of 
                             Sybase (49 tables) can be easily exceeded. This applies especially if the resulting patient 
                             report shall be used also on the warehouse database.

              Drugs and fluids: planning and ordering
                              There are two views that contain information about pharmaceutical orders. To combine these 
                              views make an "INNER JOIN" on "PatientID" and "OrderNumber" from "PV_PharmaOrders" 
                              to "PV_PharmaOrdersPreparations". Additionally, there is a view "PV_SignPharmaOrders"
