# Licensing information for Clinisoft component

Clinisoft component as delivered in the packaged tgz uses programs from CentOS, Ubuntu and HDInsight and there is no linking, modification or other similar potentially problematic ways forms of use.

However, to be able to actually use the Clinisoft component, Sybase JDBC driver must be separately installed as we interpreted Sybase's license as disallowing us to package it in our delivery package. The practical procedure for this is documented in KäyttöönOtto.md.
